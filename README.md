# AoC2022

Advent of Code 2022 - https://adventofcode.com/2022

Due to some uninspired brute-force solutions implemented for some of the puzzles, please make sure
to build and run in release mode (`cargo run --release ...`) to take advantage of the compiler
optimizations (and then go make yourself a cup of tea because _day16_ still takes ~6 min to finish
even in release mode).
